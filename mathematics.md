I haven't touched mathematics in the past 15 years or so. Today, I spend more time with haskell, clojure, scala and ml, where I would benefit a lot from a good understanding of mathematics. I anyway, wanted to revisit mathematics, this gives me a very good chance. In the coming few months/years, I plan to learn mathematics and I am collecting good resources for that. I am sharing with you, these resources. Please remember that I am poor at mathematics and I might not have read more than a few pages of most of these books. Before you ask, I own most if not all of these books.

I have almost forgotten everything about mathematics. The following book, hopefully would motivate me to learn mathematics and learn it well. Not just that, I hope it explains exactly what mathematics is, in contrast to the common belief.

* [Introduction to Mathematical Thinking](http://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Mathematical-Thinking-Keith-Devlin-ebook/dp/B009LTPSTO)


Almost any book, including those for beginners, would at least assume some knowledge of set theory. I need a concise, informal, entertaining book on set theory, and the following book, which could be read by almost everyone including those in high school, should help me.

* [Naive Set Theory](http://www.amazon.com/Naive-Set-Theory-Paul-Halmos/dp/1614271313)

Basic understanding of Algebra is essential. The following book is extremely famous, an old classic, recommended by most.

* [Algebra - Israel M. Gelfand](http://www.amazon.com/Algebra-Israel-M-Gelfand/dp/0817636773)

If I need another simpler book, I could read the following book. Recommended by Alex Stepanov.

* [Algebra](http://www.amazon.com/Algebra-An-Elementary-Text-Book-set/dp/0821819313)

Many would consider number theory to be equally important. The following book was suggested by Alex Stepanov in one of his books/articles.

* [Elements of Number Theory](http://www.amazon.com/Elements-Number-Theory-Undergraduate-Mathematics/dp/0387955879)

Mathematics is mathematical logic. There is no distinction in my mind. Mathematical logic is extremely useful for anyone, especially programmers. If anyone says you need math to be a functional programmer, they most often mean mathematical logic, not arithmetic.

This is supposed to be a very simple, informal introduction to logic, best seller. :-)

* [How to Prove It: A Structured Approach](http://www.amazon.com/How-Prove-It-Structured-Approach/dp/0521675995)

Perhaps, THE book on logic, for beginners. The author is very famous for his books and accessible writing style.

* [A Beginner's Guide to Mathematical Logic](http://www.amazon.com/Beginners-Guide-Mathematical-Logic-Mathematics-ebook/dp/B00LV8EJJI)

The following books should complement the other books on logic really well/

* [The Art of Proof](http://www.amazon.com/The-Art-Proof-Mathematics-Undergraduate/dp/1441970223)

* [Book of Proof](http://www.amazon.com/Book-Proof-Richard-Hammack/dp/0989472108)

* [Proofs from THE BOOK](http://www.amazon.com/Proofs-THE-BOOK-Martin-Aigner/dp/3662442043)

* [TO MOCK A MOCKING BIRD](http://www.amazon.com/TO-MOCK-A-MOCKING-BIRD/dp/0394534913)


I would perhaps need to learn a lot of topics in mathematics, giving me a good idea of the breadth of mathematics. No book can cover all topics in mathematics, but the following books cover the most essential topics in mathematics. These could be considered as comprehensive.

This book was suggested to me by Bjarne Stroustrup in one of his emails. It's a very accessible book, covering huge range of topics, and providing historical context for each topic introduced. I really believe I would love this.

* [Mathematics: From the Birth of Numbers](http://www.amazon.com/Mathematics-Birth-Numbers-Jan-Gullberg/dp/039304002X)

Nobody wants to miss a book by Knuth, right? This would be useful for programmers, especially those interested in analysis of algorithms. This isn't going to be easy, but with the above books, should not be too difficult.

* [Concrete Mathematics: A Foundation for Computer Science ](http://www.amazon.com/Concrete-Mathematics-Foundation-Computer-Science/dp/0201558025)

Another concise, comprehensive math book. Extremely famous, by eminent authors.

* [What Is Mathematics? An Elementary Approach to Ideas and Methods](http://www.amazon.com/Mathematics-Elementary-Approach-Ideas-Methods/dp/0195105192)

At this point, hopefully, I should be ready to read mathematics books more relevant or specific to programming. The following books is considered a classic, game changing book on category theory, extremely relevant if you need to understand concepts in haskell, scala and the like(typed functional languages)

* [Conceptual Mathematics: A First Introduction to Categories](http://www.amazon.com/Conceptual-Mathematics-First-Introduction-Categories/dp/052171916X)

If you are a programmers, you cannot miss discrete mathematics. Wouldn't it be a dream come true, if we could learn math with Haskell?

* [Discrete Mathematics Using a Computer](http://www.amazon.com/Discrete-Mathematics-Using-Computer-ODonnell/dp/1846282411)

The best, a classic on type theory. Read it a long back, time to revisit this. I really like Pierce's writing style.

* [Types and Programming Languages](http://www.amazon.com/Types-Programming-Languages-Benjamin-Pierce/dp/0262162091)

If you are interested in theoretical computer science you would love the following books. These two books discuss the two different yet equivalent models of computing.

* [An Introduction to Functional Programming Through Lambda Calculus](http://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Functional-Programming-Calculus-Mathematics/dp/0486478831)

* [The Annotated Turing](http://www.amazon.com/Annotated-Turing-Through-Historic-Computability/dp/0470229055)

Need a less formal book on the above topics? This is why I love the ruby community. :-)

* [Understanding Computation](http://www.amazon.com/Understanding-Computation-Machines-Impossible-Programs/dp/1449329276)

Some nice recreational/historical books in mathematics

* [The Joy of X: A Guided Tour of Mathematics, from One to Infinity](http://www.amazon.com/Joy-Guided-Tour-Mathematics-Infinity-ebook/dp/B00A25NMO4)
* [Journey through Genius: The Great Theorems of Mathematics](http://www.amazon.com/Journey-through-Genius-Theorems-Mathematics/dp/014014739X)
* [God Created The Integers](http://www.amazon.com/God-Created-Integers-Mathematical-Breakthroughs-ebook/dp/B008164Q5A)
