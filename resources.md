#Resources

###Bash

Most of the javascript programmers today, work on unix based operating systems like osx, linux. We want you to use linux, so that you understand the workflow most javascript developers use, and be able to appreciate the benefits of this specific approach. Shell is a very important part of that, perhaps the most important part and you need to have a good working knowledge of bash shell. I recommend the following two resources for bash.

* <http://cli.learncodethehardway.org/book/>
* <http://conqueringthecommandline.com>

*Please use zsh instead of bash shell*. zsh is almost fully compatible with bash only better. You could use my gist to get your ubuntu setup properly.

###git

Next you need to learn git. Not only does it help you version code, allows many programmers to work on the same project, it also helps you in figuring out the right workflow, and encourages you to build your application in a piecemeal manner. I would recommend the following resources.

###Editor

Most of the development time is spent in our editors. That's a very important choice and a personal choice. We would want at least one of the programmers in every projects to use on of vim, emacs or sublime text. Of course, if everyone can use one of these editors, it would be great. I would recommend vim, it's good, and immensely popular. You will find it difficult initially, but with time(a few weeks to months), you should be fine. You could also opt for emacs, especially if you already have some experience with it. **I would highly recommend one of these two editors(vim or emacs), both are open source, have a huge community and stood the  test of time, and have been available for decades**. If you can't adjust to any of these, you could use 'notepad like' editor sublime text 3. In future, you can shift to webstorm. Also please note that .NET developers should stick to visual studio for C#, though you could choose to  use one of these editors for html/css/javascript.
